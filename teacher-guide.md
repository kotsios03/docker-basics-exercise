# Teacher Guide

Suggested flow (45–60 min):

1) 5–10 min — Explain images vs. containers and the goals
2) 10–15 min — Students complete Tasks 1–2 (install, build, run)
3) 10–15 min — Students complete Tasks 3–4 (volumes, env)
4) 10–15 min — Students complete Tasks 5–6 (logs/cleanup, push)
5) 5 min — Debrief: reproducibility, tags, cleanup routines

Rubric (10 points):

- (2) Install/Verify: ran hello-world
- (2) Build/Run: built image and mapped port
- (2) Volumes: demonstrated bind mount
- (2) Env: changed app behavior via env var
- (2) Hygiene/Push: logs+cleanup and optional push

Tips:

- Encourage clear naming and tagging
- If push is blocked by classroom network, allow local-only completion
