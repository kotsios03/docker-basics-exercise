# Task 1 — Install and verify

Goal: make sure Docker is installed and can run a container.

Steps:

1) Finish [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md) if you haven't yet.
2) Open a new terminal and type:
   - `docker --version`
   - `docker run hello-world`
3) If you see the hello-world success message, you’re good to move on.

Hints:

- If hello-world fails, open Docker Desktop and wait until it says “Running.”
- On Windows, WSL 2 must be enabled (Docker Desktop can guide you).
