# Task 1 — Install and verify

Goal: Ensure Docker is installed and working.

Steps:

1) Complete [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md) if needed
2) Open a new terminal and run:
   - `docker --version`
   - `docker run hello-world`
3) If the hello-world message appears, you’re ready.

Hints:

- If hello-world fails, open Docker Desktop and wait until it says “Running”
- On Windows, WSL 2 must be enabled (Docker Desktop can guide you)
