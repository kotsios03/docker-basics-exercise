# Docker Basics: Mini Exercise (45–60 min)

A hands-on exercise to learn core Docker workflows: images, containers, ports, volumes, environment variables, and pushing to a registry.

Audience: High school students, first-time Docker users.

## Setup

If you don't have Docker or an account for a registry yet, follow [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) first.

## What students will practice

- Building an image from a Dockerfile
- Running containers and mapping ports
- Using volumes (bind mounts)
- Passing environment variables
- Viewing logs and cleaning up
- Tagging and pushing an image to a registry

## Quick start

0) If needed, complete [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
1) Clone or fork this repo to your computer.
2) Complete the tasks in order:
   - tasks/01-install-and-verify.md
   - tasks/02-build-and-run.md
   - tasks/03-volumes.md
   - tasks/04-env-and-config.md
   - tasks/05-logs-and-cleanup.md
   - tasks/06-tag-and-push.md (optional if no registry account)
3) Share your notes or screenshots with your teacher.

## Repo structure

- starter/ — a tiny web app with a Dockerfile
- tasks/ — step-by-step instructions
- CHECKLIST.md — self-check of what you completed

## Submission

- Provide a short summary of what you ran, plus your image name and tags.
- If you pushed, share your image page URL from the registry.
